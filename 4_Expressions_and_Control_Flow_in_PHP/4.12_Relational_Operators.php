/**
 * In PHP, there are three types of relational operators:
 * 
 * 1. Equality operators: These operators are used to compare two values for equality.
 *    The equality operators are '==' (equal) and '!=' (not equal).
 * 
 * 2. Comparison operators: These operators are used to compare two values and determine
 *    their relationship in terms of greater than, less than, or equal to.
 *    The comparison operators are '>', '<', '>=', and '<='.
 * 
 * 3. Logical operators: These operators are used to combine multiple conditions and
 *    evaluate them as a single boolean value.
 *    The logical operators are '&&' (logical AND), '||' (logical OR), and '!' (logical NOT).
 * 
 * These relational operators are commonly used in conditional statements and loops to
 * control the flow of execution based on certain conditions.
