/*
The general syntax of a function is as follows:
function function_name([parameter [, ...]]){
    // Statements
    }
The first line of the syntax idicates the following:
- A definition starts with the word function
- A name follows, which must start with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers or undescores.
- The parentheses are required.
- One or more parameters, separated by commas, are optional (as indicated by the square brackets).

Function names are case-sensitive, so all of the following strings can refer to the print function: PRINT, Print, and PrInT.
